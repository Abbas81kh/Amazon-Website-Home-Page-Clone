This project is a clone of Amazon's home page built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the design and layout of the original Amazon website, 
focusing on front-end development practice. The website includes a navbar with search functionality, a banner section, a product grid layout, 
and a footer with multiple links. However, it is not responsive and is best viewed on desktop screens only.

The project is built using HTML and CSS and can be run by cloning the repository and opening the index.html file in a web browser. 
Future improvements may include making the website responsive for mobile and tablet screens and adding JavaScript for interactivity. 
Contributions are welcome, and developers can fork the repository and submit pull requests.
